                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings,
                    most of which date from the last two years of his life. Let's take a look at two of his best paintings.</p><br>

                <p>Starry Night is one of the most recognized pieces of art in the world. It is absolutely everywhere, too. It can be seen on coffee, mugs, t-shirts, towels, magnets, etc. Honestly, it sometimes feels as if the painting’s fame has exceeded
                    that of its creator. It is a magnificent piece of art. That Starry Night resonates with so many people is a testament to how its beauty is timeless and universal.

                <img src=assets/images/starry-night3.jpg><br>
                <p>As was well known about Van Gogh, he enjoyed walking to locations to paint on site. With this painting, he went to the café at night to do this job. He described the process in the letter, “I enormously enjoy painting on the spot at night.
                    In the past they used to draw, and paint the picture from the drawing in the daytime. But I find that it suits me to paint the thing straightaway. It’s quite true that I may take a blue for a green in the dark, a blue lilac for a pink
                    lilac, since you can’t make out the nature of the tone clearly. But it’s the only way of getting away from the conventional black night…” His goal was to bring to life a night painting that uses “nothing but beautiful blue, violet
                    and green.” Looking at the painting proves this is true. Black is not used for the night sky or even the shadowed buildings. Instead it is used to create the cobblestones and some of the figures, reducing them to minor details of the
                    painting. Van Gogh found that only by being there could he capture the true colors he saw in the moment.</p><br>
